Hi <%= @user&.username %>,

Re: Your two-factor authentication backup code


You're receiving this email because you have two-factor authentication enabled on your Codidact network account. We've
recently added backup codes for every account using 2FA, so that you can still log in if you lose access to your
authenticator app.

Your backup code is shown below. Please save it somewhere safe. Please note that logging in using this backup code
will disable 2FA on your account so that you can reconfigure it using a new app or device - this will also
reset your backup code.

Your backup code: <%= @user&.backup_2fa_code %>

Thanks,
The Codidact Team
