<p>Another thing: this site is community-run.</p>
<p>There is no for-profit company behind it, and the organization providing the platform won't interfere with community business.</p>
<p>
    This means that all community-governance issues need to be decided in the local meta category.
    This is a special category, which isn't about the topic of the current site but about the community.
    There is also a global Meta community on <a href="https://meta.codidact.com">meta.codidact.com</a>, where network-wide issues are resolved.
</p>
<p>If you want a new feature or if you find a bug, you can (and should) suggest/report it in the local meta category or on Codidact Meta.</p>
